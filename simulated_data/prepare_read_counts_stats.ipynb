    "## Aim of this notebook\n",
    "This notebook contains the preparation required to run read simulations using the read simulation pipeline published in this repository.  \n",
    "The main aim of this notebook is to provide a working recipe for a read simulation run that is based on real-world data. In contrast to whole-genome data, for which real-world datasets are readily availble from the [Pf8 resource](https://www.malariagen.net/resource/36/), amplicon data for a pipeline that may have been developed for a specific amplicon primer panel, my not be available from public resources. In this case, simulating reads may be the only option for pipeline validation. Use this notebook as a guideline on how to generate the input files for a read simulation pipeline run."

    "## Part 1: read counts to guide simulation\n",
    "An important consideration for a simulated dataset is the number of reads to create. This should be within the range of expected read numbers from real-world experiments because unrealistically high or low read counts will not provide useful insights into the validity of pipeline results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are simulating reads for a wild-type and a mutant _P. falciparum_ strain. We will simulate an AmpSeq run using the [SpotMalaria](https://www.malariagen.net/project/spotmalaria/) panel, as used for the [GenRe Mekong project](https://www.malariagen.net/resource/29/) project. \n",
